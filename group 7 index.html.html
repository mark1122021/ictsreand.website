    <h4>ICT STRAND IN LANHS</h4> 
    <h3><b>Information and communication technologies (ICT) is defined as a diverse set of technological tools and resources used to transmit, store, create, share or exchange information. These technological tools and resources include computers, the Internet (websites, blogs and emails), live broadcasting technologies (radio, television and webcasting), recorded broadcasting technologies (podcasting, audio and video players, and storage devices) and telephony (fixed or mobile, satellite, visio/video-conferencing, etc.).We reaffirm that the most effective policy to integrate ICT in education is through whole school-based planning, teacher training and professional development. We highlight that the challenge is not only to develop ICT competency standards for teachers and prepare teachers to integrate ICT in their pedagogy, but also to offer continuous support and to provide them with the incentives and the professional motivation to unlock ICT to enhance the quality of learning. To incentivize teachers, governments and institutions are recommended to integrate the evaluation of the use of ICT by institutions and teachers into the systems and practices for monitoring the quality of learning.

    <h3>ICT PROMOTION

This function will ensure continuous investment growth in the ICT sector and that ICT entrepreneurs will be at the center of the plans to achieve socially sustainable and inclusive development goals and create job opportunities for our youth.

        Promote Regions in the digital economy(e.g. Dar es Salaam as ICT Driver and Engine of Growth).
        Promote Tanzania to be competitive in the Digital Economy.
         
        
        To achieve that the ICT Commission will coordinate promotion activities in the following digital transformation areas:
